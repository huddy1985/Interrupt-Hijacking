This is a kernel module meant to demonstrate how the interupt handler works and how can we create our own interupt in Linux Kernel. In this example I hijack the interupt 0 i.e. divide by zero interupt and print a message in the kernel promt and revert it back to the original interupt. 
Please Note: This only works for 32 bit Linux Kernel
